TensorFleet Toolchain Placeholder
================================

This directory represents bundled binaries that ship with the TensorFleet Drone
VS Code extension. Replace these placeholder files with the actual tool
archives or installers (e.g., ROS 2 distributions, mission planning CLIs,
telemetry helpers) before packaging the extension.

Files copied from this folder will be installed into a
"tensorfleet-tools" directory chosen by the user.
